    In Scotland the DMS in use (PCTI Docman), has a function to allow electronic document interchange between practices on transfer, thus a receiving practice will receive all the previous practice's documents for that patient with their original filing attributes. A process by which the patient's clinical record is printed to a file, which is then attached to the Docman record, is used to provide a readable version of the clinical record with the Docman transfer (More information on GP2GP is available in Chapter 8).

                <p>Chapter 9 -- A pathway to good paperless practice</p>
<h3 id="91-introduction">9.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#91-introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This chapter will provide guidance for practices on how they can change
their business processes towards "paperless" working.</p>
<p>We will include discussion of the grades and requirements for paperless
working as an outline pathway for change, and explore the risks and
benefits of this method of working. The chapter will have safety and
governance at its core; ensuring practices are supplied with the
information they need to achieve these changes safely and without
compromising continuity. Practical advice will include how to create and
maintain a high quality electronic record; guidance for clinicians on
how to consult using computerised records; how to record encounters; how
to manage scanning of documents, both current and historical; document
retention and shredding; standards for achieving and maintaining
approval from governing bodies; practical aspects of messaging to and
from the clinical information systems; business continuity; and where to
obtain further support and assistance. The chapter will conclude with
the recommended process for practices to gain and maintain their
paperless accreditation status.</p>
<h3 id="92-about-this-chapter">9.2 About this chapter<a class="headerlink" href="#92-about-this-chapter" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The term 'Paperless Practice' is widely used to refer to various grades
of working with electronic records instead of paper. At its simplest
this means 'working without paper notes', where 'paper notes' refers to
the Lloyd George or A4 clinical cards traditionally used to record
narratives of patient encounters. The term 'Note-less' is used for
practices that record the day-to-day encounters on the computer record
system (and not on paper), but may still be using a paper repository of
correspondence. Similarly, the term 'Paper-light' describes practices,
which, in addition to working note-less, also employ a scanning, or
"Document Management System" (DMS) to handle paper correspondence and
other files associated with patients' records.</p>
<p>Inevitably all practices will have to continue to manage paper documents
at some level, both received by and sent from the practice, thus working
entirely without paper is impossible[^1]. There are, however, areas of
general practice business historically reliant on paper workflows that
can be operated more usefully, efficiently and safely by employing
information technologies. Practices planning to move to 'Paperless'
working must decide which functions of their practice business they wish
to change and why, and consider the impact of these changes on other
areas of the practice and upon the people who work for it.</p>
<p>In common with all business changes supported by or dependent on
information technologies, the biggest challenges will arise from
managing the change for your practice team and supporting them in these
new ways of working.</p>
<h3 id="93-from-paper-to-paper-free">9.3 From paper to paper-free<a class="headerlink" href="#93-from-paper-to-paper-free" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>It is today very rare for a UK general practice to operate without any
clinical information system (Clinical Computer System). The introduction
of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in 2004[^2] has resulted in
the vast majority of practices using their clinical information systems
to capture some clinical data in a structured way. As a consequence of
this, and other business requirements, all practices working for the NHS
should have a clinical information system containing at least
demographic data and basic electronic clinical records as required to
meet QOF reporting.</p>
<p>Many practices that have partially evolved their use of computers for
managing clinical data will find themselves in a mixed economy of paper
and electronic records. This change has not been without difficulty and
may not always have been approached systematically or with care. Some
practices may only be using the minimum required functions of their
clinical information system to support the demands of the contract,
whilst others may have systematically moved towards paper-light working.</p>
<h3 id="94-pre-requisites">9.4 Pre-requisites<a class="headerlink" href="#94-pre-requisites" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<h3 id="941-motivation">9.4.1 Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#941-motivation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Practices should consider the reasons they wish to move to paper-light
working, the challenges involved and how these will affect individuals
in the organisation. Having the support of the whole practice team is
ideal, but most organisations will find people who are reluctant to
change to new ways of working. Consensus amongst the management team of
the practice and a clear statement of intent can assist with this.
Describing the benefits to your team may also help, as well as an
awareness of where there will be difficulty and recognition that some
staff will require more hand holding and support than others.</p>
<p>In order to work paper-light <em>all</em> practice staff must be prepared to
change. Clinicians may find their consultation style and methods of
managing their work changes substantially. Uncertainty about skills
capability, perceived threats to roles and autonomy can lead to
resistance to change as well as attempts to disrupt it. A stepwise
approach in an achievable time frame to adapting consulting techniques
and learning new computer skills can help alleviate concerns and build
confidence. Consider how the technology will change roles and
responsibilities for practice staff, and how this may impact upon the
relationships and existing structures in the practice.</p>
<p>Practices may wish to reflect good information practice in their
practice training material, induction packs for locums, GPRs and other
temporary staff and even in their partnership agreements and employment
contracts.</p>
<p>Practices should be cautious about moving to paper-light working as a
mechanism to fix a dysfunctional system in their practice. Information
technology can be used as a tool to support a business process, but if
that process is already suboptimal then it is less likely that
computerising it will result in success -- do not computerise a problem.</p>
<h3 id="942-infrastructure-hardware-and-software">9.4.2 Infrastructure, Hardware and Software<a class="headerlink" href="#942-infrastructure-hardware-and-software" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A review of the practice's hardware, software and network infrastructure
should be undertaken to establish requirements for improvements needed
to allow the practice to work paper-light.</p>
<p>Your PCO will be responsible for ensuring your computer systems meet the
minimum requirements to allow you to manage practice business. Practices
should contact their IM&amp;T department for support in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 9.4.2a Hardware</strong></p>
<p>Your PCO will supply standard equipment only, to a minimum recommended specification for the applications the practice intends to run. Negotiation of changes or improvements to these specifications is a matter for individual practices. Workstations   Aim for one per consulting room; adequate numbers in administrative and patient facing areas; meeting rooms; laptops to support remote working</p>
<hr />
<p>Printers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Dual bins in consulting rooms, also useful in administrative areas
  Monitors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Larger monitors allow for more information to be shown; a rotating base and inbuilt speakers or USB hubs are also useful
  Input Devices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Keyboards, mice, and other devices such as trackballs are a matter of individual choice. Providing specific piece of hardware in this regard can ease the transition for members of the team who may be struggling</p>
<h2 id="software">Software<a class="headerlink" href="#software" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>General Practices should always check the constraints for local software
installation with their PCO as policies may restrict or even forbid the
installation of software to servers or workstations by practices.</p>
<p>Users working in remote desktop environments will similarly find that
their ability to install specific software tools will be constrained.
Depending on the hosting service, and the clinical system in use, an
approved list of third party applications may be available.</p>
<p>Approved NHS GP systems in England are listed on the NHS CfH website<a href="http://www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/systemsandservices/gpsupport/gpsoc/systems/suppliers">^3</a></p>
<p><strong>\

<p>Figure 9.4.2b Software</p>
<p>Clinical Information System   All NHS approved GP systems are able to support paper-light working. Changing your clinical system should not be undertaken lightly and only where there will be clear functional or practical advantage.</p>
<hr />
<p>Document Management System    For scanning correspondence and other documents, an essential component of paper-light.
  Office Software               Word processor and Spreadsheet programs, often with other applications included as a suite. Microsoft Office is commonly installed on workstations in the NHS.
  Other Software                Practices may wish to use specific software packages for a variety of purposes, but care should be taken when installing other software. Check with your PCO IT department.</p>
<p>Figure 9.4.2c Network Infrastructure</p>
<p>Network Access Points   Ensure adequate numbers in locations suitably positioned to avoid running cables over floors and desks. Consider also for power outlets.</p>
<hr />
<p>Branch Sites            If the practice has a branch site then a solution must be found to link all the sites to the clinical database.
  Remote Working          Working from home or from other locations, if required, then a method of access must be supplied and configured by the PCO or system supplier.
  Bandwidth               Adequate bandwidth into and out of the practice will be needed as the practice starts to use more NHS on line services.</p>

<h3 id="943-continuity-planning">9.4.3 Continuity Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#943-continuity-planning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>'Continuity planning' refers to the procedures and actions you employ to
reduce the risks associated with loss of access to your computer
systems.</p>
<p>As you move practice functions to the clinical information system it
becomes increasingly difficult to manage the practice without them.
Events such as fire, flood, theft, power cuts and technical problems can
all result in at least temporary loss of access to the system and
occasionally loss of data.</p>
<p>It is also a Data Protection Act requirement to store records safely
(see also chapter 4.2.4)</p>
<p>9.4.3.1 Backups</p>
<p>Backup is essential for all practices that store any important business
data locally. Practices working on centrally hosted desktops should have
their clinical data, and any other data they store there, backed up by
the service provider. This will be part of the service level agreement
(SLA) that your PCO holds with the system supplier.</p>
<p>Where practices have locally stored data they must establish a backup
schedule, and periodically have that backup verified to ensure data
could be restored in the event of loss of the original. Remember any
data not stored on servers such as any personal files on the local
workstation. Users should be encouraged to store critical business data
on backed up drives and be warned that locally stored files are at risk.</p>
<p>The costs of data loss include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The cost of continuing without the data</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The cost of recreating the data</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The cost of notifying users in the event of a compromise</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Practices have a responsibility for data governance commensurate with
their role as custodians of confidential medical records. It would be
hard to defend against losing patients' medical records through
negligence or omission.</p>
<p>9.4.3.1.1 Backup Media</p>
<p>Your PCO IT department will be able to advise on the best backup medium
for your circumstances.</p>
<p>Tape Backups       Commonly employed, large capacity, cheap, re-usable, established practices and software.</p>
<hr />
<p>Optical backup     DVD, limited capacity, rarely suitable for full data backups, BluRay not widely employed.
  Removable Drives   Large capacity removable hard drives can be used effectively for backup, more economical in recent years.
  Network backup     On line backup services are not yet approved for NHS use due to encryption, storage location and bandwidth.</p>
<p>Whatever medium is used for backup the data must be encrypted if the
backups will be taken off site.</p>
<p>9.4.3.1.2 Backup Schedule</p>
<p>A rotating back up schedule is typically used, normally with a nightly
backup stored on site, and a weekly backup, suitably encrypted, taken
off site. An alternative to off-site backups is to use a fireproof safe,
but this is unreliable and may not protect your data in a severe fire or
flood and, of course, could be stolen.</p>
<p>Practices should include the responsibility for the management and
checking of system backups in the job description of a member of staff,
often the practice manager. It should be made clear that failure to do
this task will be a disciplinary matter, potentially resulting in
dismissal.</p>
<p>9.4.3.1.3 'Live' local copies</p>
<p>Some clinical systems allow for a local copy of the system and data to
be hosted on a workstation, which may then allow for limited access to
the data in an emergency.</p>
<h3 id="_2"><a class="headerlink" href="#_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong>9.4.3.2 Working without the computer</strong></p>
<p>9.4.3.2.1 Planned downtime</p>
<p>Most systems and networks require upgrading and maintenance, which will
occasionally result in temporary loss of access to your system. These
events can be planned for, and may be able to be completed outside of
normal business hours.</p>
<p>Where downtime is required during the working week, practices should
schedule it for quieter periods of the day and re-schedule tasks that
make intensive use of the computers to a different time.</p>
<p>9.4.3.2.2 Unplanned downtime</p>
<ul>
<li>Single machine
    --------------</li>
</ul>
<p>Practices should create a checklist for use if a single workstation or
printer in the practice stops functioning as expected. This will enable
non-technical staff to work through a troubleshooting process. Such
checklists should always include the contact details for IT support. A
checklist need not be overly complicated and can, of course, only be as
comprehensive as the technical expertise in the practice will allow.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Is the power lead plugged in and the machine switched on?</p>
<hr />
<p>Try turning the computer off, and then back on again.
  Contact Tracy on ext 2134
  If Tracy is not in phone IT Support on 01236789876</p>
<p>Where the problem cannot be rapidly fixed, it may be useful to have a
'swap out' machine -- a workstation that is functional but not in use,
that can be substituted at short notice if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>All machines
    ------------</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the network fails, or the server develops problems, you may find
your practice abruptly and unexpectedly without access to the clinical
system. This is never an easy scenario to manage and how you do so will
depend on the practice's own circumstances.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Delegate the task of contacting IT support and have this done
    immediately</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Have staff trained and aware of how to handle patient requests and
    contacts without the computer system -- a temporary paper system
    backup.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It may not be unreasonable to move to 'emergencies only' working
    until the systems are returned to normal. It is potentially unsafe
    to do routine consulting without access to the clinical record.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Inform patients in the waiting room of delays and the reasons for
    them.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Consider how manually collected data handwritten during periods of
    downtime will be retrospectively entered to the system.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>9.4.3.3 Fire, flood and Theft</p>
<p>Major data loss disasters, which may also result in damage or
destruction of the practice infrastructure, are thankfully rare. In the
event of such an occurrence you will rely on the latest data backup to
restore your practice system, but repair of premises and other material
damage is outside the scope of this document. Contact your PCO and
system supplier as soon as possible; use their advice and help.
Paper-light practices can be reassured that their patient data should be
able to be restored from backup, once systems are operational again.
Practices that remain reliant on paper notes will perhaps not be so
fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="944-training">9.4.4 Training<a class="headerlink" href="#944-training" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This document assumes that the practice has in place an approved
clinical information system and, consequently, that a level of skill and
knowledge of use of the system already exists within the practice.
Nevertheless, assessment of individual and team training needs should be
undertaken and a plan drawn up for addressing these needs. Readers
should refer to Chapter 12 of these guidelines.</p>

<p>It is important to recognise that whilst there are many positive gains
to paper-light working there may also be some losses. For example, loss
of 'coffee time' chats, where clinicians traditionally meet to read and
discuss incoming mail can change the dynamic of communication in the
practice. Similarly, someone whose role was to maintain a paper
appointment book may find a substantial part of his or her job changed
or even removed from them.</p>
<h3 id="951-benefits">9.5.1 Benefits<a class="headerlink" href="#951-benefits" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>

<p>Much of the value of paper-light working comes from good data. It is
therefore important that all members of the practice team understand how
to record data on the system correctly.</p>
<p>Data quality means capturing information from interactions with the
patient as accurately as possible in a way that is usefully computable.
How much 'computability' you require, or can achieve, will depend on
individual practice requirements and the clinical information system in
use.</p>
<p>Although the primary purpose of the record is for patient care, other
uses such as clinical and process audit, research, education, service
planning and contract delivery are also important.</p>
<p>PRIMIS<a href="http://www.primis.nhs.uk/">^4</a> and GPRD<a href="http://www.gprd.com/">^5</a> have been instrumental in defining standards and
procedures for improving data quality in Primary Care in the UK. Chapter

<h3 id="962-processes-for-data-capture">9.6.2 Processes for data capture<a class="headerlink" href="#962-processes-for-data-capture" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Data capture cannot be left to any one individual person in a practice
-- it is a job for the whole practice team.</p>
<p><strong>Support Patient Care</strong> - The primary purpose of the medical record is
to support the care of the patient. Consequently everyone in the
practice has a responsibility to ensure the record is complete,
accurate, legible, comprehensible and maintained at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Every one participates</strong> - All clinicians must take part in recording
data to ensure the whole practice population is covered. It is not
acceptable for some clinicians to record electronically whilst others
continue to record only onto paper notes. Such duplicate systems run the
risk of disparate records, which can confuse patient care, increase the
risk of error and be medico-legally indefensible.</p>
<p><strong>Every encounter</strong> - Procedures must be in place to ensure that every
clinical encounter is recorded on the computer system. This includes
encounters in the practice and those that may occur outside on home
visits as well as encounters with temporary staff such as <strong>locum</strong>
GP<strong>s</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>All prescriptions</strong> - A complete, chronological medication record is
essential for paper-light working. All medication records must be added
to the computer system, and all deletions, cancellations and amendments
also recorded by updating the computer record. Prescriptions that may
have been handwritten will need to be added back to the computer as
handwritten on return to the practice. . Similarly, where it is known
that a patient has taken OTC medication this should be added to the
computer system and where it is known that a patient has been issued
medication from another organisation, e.g. as part of a discharge, this
should also be added to the computer. Most GP systems allow these other
types of medication issue to be recorded alongside that issued by the
practice and having all of a patient's medication history can prove to
be extremely useful. It may be prudent when visiting patients, if
possible, to delay issuing prescriptions until return to the surgery
when the prescribing can be completed using the computer system. This
ensures decision support and avoids transcription errors and, with the

<p><strong>Agree coding standards</strong> - Every practice and every clinical
information system is different, and the requirements of how granular
the coding level is within a practice will depend on what the practice
wants and, within the constraints of the clinical system, what is
possible. Practices should agree which data is recorded in a structured
way, which codes or groups of codes will be employed and how that data
may be best entered. The requirements will be based on variables such as
contractual necessities; practice population; special interests of the
practice; secondary uses of the records; competence with the systems;
requirements for audit and research and clinical safety.</p>
<p><strong>Use templates and coding lists</strong> - Practices can encourage
standardisation of coding within their local organisation by using
clinical system provided code subsets, formularies or 'favourites'. For
specific disease management and contract areas bespoke or centrally
distributed data entry and review screens can be employed that mandate
structured data entry to an agreed code list (e.g. picking lists or
synonym lists).</p>

<h3 id="963-coding-systems">9.6.3 Coding systems<a class="headerlink" href="#963-coding-systems" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Computer systems have great difficulty in analysing freely typed
narrative for significant meaning. As computers are very good at
processing numbers, for clinical data entry to be useful the data we
enter must conform to some type of numbering, or clinical coding,
schema. This attaches 'codes' to clinical terms -- terms are textual
descriptions of clinical concepts such as symptoms or diseases. Chapters
6 &amp; 7 of these guidelines provide more information.</p>
<p>GP clinical systems will conform to a coding system approved for NHS use
and allow users to enter a coded item in a variety of ways. Commonly a
coded clinical term is added with an attached 'free text' comment.
Subsets of the codes from a terminology may constrain the immediately
available terms to the user depending on the context of the task, or
their role or organisation. By reducing the number of available terms
this can make it easier for a user to find an appropriate code.</p>
<p>In practice the conversion of clinical encounters to structured coded
data can be quite difficult, especially for non-technical users used to
working with handwritten narratives. Systems try and make the task of
finding clinical terms easier using a variety of user interface and
functional techniques and it is rare with today's systems for users to
have to enter data using the clinical code directly -- most systems are
able to locate appropriate terms using text searches. Because any coding
system is an abstraction of real clinical practice there will always be
occasional difficulties finding a clinical term that exactly captures
the clinician's meaning. New users can find this frustrating and unless
provided with guidance and strategies may find workarounds that hinder
data quality.</p>
<h3 id="9631-what-is-a-structured-record">9.6.3.1 What is a Structured Record?<a class="headerlink" href="#9631-what-is-a-structured-record" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Clinical information systems aim to provide clinicians with a place to
record clinical data. To do this they must apply a model of clinical
practice into language that the computer systems can utilise.</p>
<p>When users write a clinical note they also apply 'structure' to it --
they note the date of the encounter, the type of the encounter and who
they are. Within the clinical narrative users make use of clinical
shorthand and convention to denote, for example a blood pressure
reading. A blood pressure reading has values such as Systolic and
Diastolic. If a user records these as free text then the computer will
have no way of identifying that the user has entered a blood pressure,
nor what the respective values for the readings are. To get round this
problem clinical modellers create a representation of a blood pressure
in the computer record. This will have a place to record the Systolic
value and the Diastolic value and a label, perhaps a clinical term,
which identifies it to the system as a blood pressure reading. In other
words, it is stored as a 'structured record'.</p>
<p>Clinical information systems all differ in their clinical models, the
extent and scope of the models and how the users access and use them.</p>

<p>It is helpful for clinical users in particular to be given a basic
understanding of the clinical terminology in use and the logic behind
the system's clinical model and structure. Whilst this sounds
complicated, it will generally be covered in training sessions from your
PCO or supplier, and need not be very detailed. If users do not
understand why the clinical system makes them record data in particular
way, nor the various levels or meanings of clinical terms they will
struggle to record data accurately or perhaps at all. (see also to
Chapter 12).</p>

<p>Many practices have adopted computer use in a piecemeal fashion and may
be operating a mixed economy of paper and electronic records. There are
significant risks associated with this type of working as well as
inherent inefficiencies and risks.</p>
<p>Finding information         By operating two or more repositories of patient information clinicians may miss important information by not knowing where to look, or that the information was there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Loss of records             Paper records risk being lost and mislaid
  Mixed prescribing records   Running two prescribing recording systems is inherently dangerous.
  Legibility                  Typed records are normally more legible. In mixed record systems it may not be clear which written entry corresponds to which computer record.
  Duplication                 Dual recording of information from the same encounter on paper and computer is not only inefficient, but risks the creation of conflicting records.
  Efficiency                  It is inevitably more efficient to use a single record system, and the always on, networked nature of the computer system favours it in this regard.</p>
<p>The practice should plan to move their core business functions to the
computer system. Functional areas to consider include:</p>
<p>Demographic / Registration data   A patient Age / Sex register</p>
<hr />
<p>Scheduling and Appointments       Appointment books for clinics and surgeries, as well as general practice calendaring and scheduling.

  Clinical Data                     Recording 'significant' medical history provides useful summaries, but the aim should be to record all encounters electronically.

  Document Management               Use of scanning software to store all incoming and outgoing paper transactions.
  Referrals and Discharges          Ensuring all referrals and outcomes are captured on the computer system.
  Transfers                         Managing patient transfers to and from the practice.

<h3 id="971-demographic-registration-data">9.7.1 Demographic / registration data<a class="headerlink" href="#971-demographic-registration-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Demographic data provides the base for managing a paperless practice.
Without this data, comprising items such as names, dates of birth,
addresses and NHS Identification numbers, the practice cannot begin to
use its clinical system. To use the system to manage patients, you must
be able to clearly match the record you are working with to a unique
patient.</p>
<p>In all parts of the UK, health authorities now hold registration data
centrally. Most practice computer systems synchronise locally held
demographic data with centrally held data. In England the Personal
Demographic Service (PDS) requires checks on the synchronicity of the
locally held data before allowing access to national services such as
"Choose and Book" (See Chapter 8a).</p>
<p>Practices are required to continue to manage registrations and transfers
using their local systems, and to ensure the data they hold is accurate
and fit for purpose. Some general rules to maintaining this data
include:</p>
<p>Avoid abbreviations                                 For example, abbreviating 'Road' to 'Rd' or 'Rd.'</p>
<hr />
<p>Use full postcodes                                  Some systems provide a post code / address lookup service
  Include phone numbers with area codes               Collect different types of phone number and ensure they are correctly labelled, e.g. 'Mobile' and 'Work'
  Include e-mail addresses                          <br />
  Employ 'Known as' and 'Sounds like' fields          For short names and pronunciation.
  Train staff on consequences of mismatched records   Can slow or prevent access to national services.
  Use NHS Numbers                                     Single unique NHS Ids such as NHS Number and CHI Number are essential for safe delivery of care
  Always create a medical record for every patient    Even for single encounters, and always before the patient receives clinical care.
  Family and Household linkage                        If your clinical system supports it, this can be useful to maintain making address changes easier and identification of household members possible.
  Do not operate two registers                        For example, for private and NHS patients. Clinical systems normally have methods of identifying patients with different registration purposes without having to create a separate list.</p>

<p>Electronic appointment systems offer huge efficiencies in general
practice. There may be a large overhead in work in setting up an
electronic system in the first instance, and at least one member of
staff should be trained and competent to do this. Migration of large
numbers of paper based appointment books and forward filling the
electronic system with future appointments may take several days,
depending on the size of the practice. An incremental approach can be
useful, but should be time limited with a clear endpoint for becoming
fully electronic.</p>
<p>Advantages include search and audit tools, multiple appointment types,
accessibility from all workstations, clinical staff able to manage own

<p>Prescribing is more efficiently and safely managed by an appropriate
computerised system, and was one of the first functions of early general
practice computing that was widely accepted (See Chapter 8f).</p>
<p>Moving from paper to computer prescribing is normally beneficial for a
practice, and can encourage reluctant clinicians to start using their
computers. Advantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Legibility</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Standardisation of drug names, packs and formulations</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Decision support for adverse reactions, contra-indications,

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Generic and brand switching, with prompts for appropriateness</em></p>

</ul>
<p>However, there are risks associated with electronic prescribing (e.g.
errors caused by incorrect use of drop-down menus, picking lists or
predictive text) and care must be taken to ensure proper training and
use of these systems.</p>
<p>Prescribing systems in the NHS in England must now conform to the
Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d), a terminology for
therapeutics<a href="http://www.dmd.nhs.uk/&gt;,">^6</a>. This change has been to support the Electronic
Transmission of Prescriptions (ETP), and aims to standardise drug
descriptions across systems improving interoperability.</p>

<p>ETP in the UK is different in all four home nations, but all use the
same premise of sending or providing an electronic version of the
prescription to the pharmacy, either with or without a bar-coded printed
prescription (See Chapter 8f).</p>
<p>New models of prescribing are also being introduced which are intended
to improve the efficiency of repeated prescribing. The 'Electronic
Repeat Dispensing' prescription model in England aims to provide the
patient with a prescription, which may be dispensed over a period of up
to 12 months, with dispensing instances handled by the pharmacist
without a further prescription from the GP. The Electronic Chronic
Medication Service (eCMS) in Scotland is similar, but includes a
schedule of review messages and dispensing information for the
prescriber. Use of these new prescribing services should be safer and
more efficient for general practices, but to obtain the benefit all
prescribers in the practice must be using the computer system.</p>

<p>Under the 2004 GP contract one of the quality measures is that clinical
case notes are 'summarised', based in part on the advice of the GPC /
RCGP document 'Good Medical Practice for General Practitioners
(2008)<a href="http://www.rcgp.org.uk/PDF/PDS_Good_Medical_Practice_for_GPs_July_2008.pdf">^7</a>.</p>
<p>If your practice has no clinical summaries then this is a large volume
of work that needs to be addressed. More commonly today, in light of the
2004 contract, practices have a substantial number of their records
summarised, processes in place for updating these as new events occur,
and for refreshing or creating summaries for new patients as they
transfer in.</p>
<h3 id="9741-decide-what-you-want-to-code">9.7.4.1 Decide what you want to code<a class="headerlink" href="#9741-decide-what-you-want-to-code" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Practices should consider coding only 'significant' conditions when
doing retrospective data entry. What a 'significant condition' is will
necessarily vary from practice to practice, as each summary is written
primarily for local use to support decision-making and clinical care.
Consideration should also be given to other purposes that a general
practice summary may be used for. For example, the Summary Care Record
in England intends to use significant items from the GP record initially
for unscheduled care use, and the patient may also access summaries.</p>
<p>SCIMP provides guidance on clinical summaries and a recommended code
list for Read Version 2, 5 byte<a href="http://www.scimp.scot.nhs.uk/coding_readcodes.html">^8</a>. PRIMIS advice is also useful in
this regard.</p>
<p>Items practices should consider recording include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>The reasons for admissions to hospital -- the presenting symptom

<p>A practice can approach this by engaging a 'clinical coder', someone who
has been trained to use the clinical system and the terminology it uses
and is able to identify the items the practice wishes to include in its
summaries.</p>
<p>Alternatively practices may elect to have medical staff complete the
summaries, but again they must be familiar with the terminology and
protocols in place. A GP should be available to lead on this process,
and for a clinical coder to consult for queries. Audit of the summaries
is important to ensure the standard required is being met.</p>
<p>Summaries are generally established by reviewing paper records for the
patient, which may be the original NHS records including correspondence
and results or could be a printout from another practice.</p>
<p>If the practice has card based disease registers then the data from
these can be transcribed to the computer system.</p>
<p>When there is an electronic prescribing record, running searches for
drugs used in specific conditions can help identify patients who should
have these conditions recorded.</p>
<p>Ensure that 'Event Dates' are used correctly when entering historical
data. Consider using a Problem based recording for 'Active' and
'Inactive' conditions if your system supports this, or using a marker
for importance of the condition such as 'High', 'Medium or 'Low'.</p>
<p>Estimate the time required for this process by averaging the time taken
for a sample number of summaries, and multiplying by the number of
records you need to summarise. This can assist in planning the number
and type of personnel who need to be involved in the task.</p>
<p>Simply summarising a paper medical record does not mean that the
original can be safely destroyed. This should only be considered after a
document has been securely scanned to a robust document management
system - See also chapter 10.</p>

<p>Practices must have in place processes for maintaining clinical
summaries by capturing new or changed data received in correspondence
from other agencies, typically hospitals. Clinicians may use a system of
highlighting text on letters that can then be added by coding staff, or
elect to do the coding themselves. With experience and training,
clinical coding staff can identify relevant information from
correspondence independently and enter this into the patient record
without a clinician's prior review.</p>
<p>As a minimum, coding of significant morbidity and investigations from
hospital correspondence is recommended, but letters frequently contain
other data that can be usefully captured. Where this capture is
automated via a document management system, practices must ensure that
the process correctly identifies patients and accurately maps code
translations.</p>
<h3 id="9752-recording-at-consultations">9.7.5.2 Recording at consultations<a class="headerlink" href="#9752-recording-at-consultations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Practices must have in place procedures to ensure every clinical patient
contact is recorded. Data is commonly recorded during and immediately
after the consultation. The cardinal rule is to write it up at the time,
before moving onto the next encounter.</p>
<p>The content of the EPR should be <strong><em>at least as complete</em></strong> as the
equivalent written record and must record the history as relayed by the
patient, the nature and extent of examination, questions asked and
responses, etc.</p>
<p>Clinicians should be encouraged to add at least one clinical code per
encounter. The clinical system will normally capture the Clinician, the
Date and Time of the encounter and perhaps the Type of encounter, such
as a Clinic or Routine appointment, thus providing some structure to the
encounter record. It is dependent on the clinician to provide the
clinical context and code relevant data.</p>
<p>In general the chosen clinical term should represent the main purpose of
the consultation event. If there is more than one, then a clinical term
should be added for each. This may be a presenting complaint, a
diagnosis, procedure or administrative term. Users must understand the
basic structure of the clinical terminology in use in order to make an
appropriate choice, or the system must be explicit about the intended
context for the clinical term. In general practice most encounters are
managing chronic diseases, thus using symptom, examination or monitoring
codes is often more appropriate than trying to enter a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Clinicians would normally then qualify any clinical term with narrative
free text that places the coded information within the context of the
patient's story.</p>
<p>This basic method has different implementations in different systems.
For example, some systems will accept pure narrative without any
additional coded terms, whilst others will try and identify code-able
information from the free text narrative. Others mandate the selection
of at least one clinical term before any free text can be added (See
also Chapters 6 &amp; 7)</p>

enough to become competent and familiar with the practice processes.</p>
<p>Practices need to consider how to handle these circumstances depending
on their own requirements. Use of paper capture forms and subsequent
manual transcription by staff may be the only viable solution in some
instances, but practices should consider the safety issues of allowing
staff not competent to examine the electronic record to manage their
patients. It is always preferable to supply a minimum training for data
view and entry, even for unplanned visiting clinicians. The use of
simple printed guidance, computer templates and protocols can help with
this.</p>

<p>Some systems allow clinicians to use a Problem Oriented approach to
recording or vewing clinical data.</p>
<p>This is the provision of functionality to allow the creation of
'Problems' in the record, normally a label or clinical code for a
condition that is then used as the header for all associated data. For
example, a patient may have an 'Asthma' problem. The practice would
record all encounters and data related to Asthma linked to the 'Asthma'
problem, making it easier to filter and view the data together. Problems
commonly have attributes of 'Active' or 'Inactive', implying whether a
problem is current, resolved or in remission. This allows for a further
structural level of 'episodes of care'. For example, 'Back Pain' as a
problem may be active or inactive many times during a patient's life.</p>
<p>Problem orientation requires the practice to actively maintain the
problem lists and associated data over time to maintain data quality and
utility. Consequently while this may represent an additional overhead on
data maintenance and training for the practice, it is likely to
significantly improve the quality and utility of the patient records.</p>

subsequently found to be incorrect. They should be handled as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Diagnostic improvement.</strong> In this case, a patient presents on
    several occasions and the diagnosis is refined over time. New
    morbidity codes would be added over time as the diagnosis 'emerged'
    but there would be no need to amend the initial diagnosis, as it was
    not factually incorrect.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>*Amendment.</strong> There is no ethical difficulty with removing or
    correcting inaccurate or misleading information, or making a clear
    addition to incomplete information. It is important that records do
    not contain information, which may mislead another health
    professional using them. Indeed, the Data Protection Act 1998 gives
    patients a right to have inaccurate records amended. It is
    inadvisable to remove medically relevant information from patient
    records. It is important that notes provide a contemporaneous record
    of consultations and information gained about patients. Removing
    relevant medical information may give the impression that the notes
    have been tampered with, and may make later treatment and care
    decisions seem unsupported. It follows that doctors should take care
    to ensure that the records show all significant aspects of care, and
    clearly identify any decisions that were later found to have been
    inappropriate so that in the future carers do not misinterpret the
    patient\'s medical history. *</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is dispute about the accuracy of information, for example that
was recorded in the past by a previous GP, doctors should take
reasonable steps to ascertain the accuracy of information in the
records. If this is not possible, a note explaining the patients\' views
should be appended to the records. This allows health professionals
using the records in the future to be wary of placing undue weight on
disputed information.</p>
<p>Practices must be able to change or remove data in a medical record when
appropriate to do so.</p>
<h3 id="9761-data-is-incorrect">9.7.6.1 Data is incorrect<a class="headerlink" href="#9761-data-is-incorrect" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Where a record is known to be incorrect it should be deleted or changed.
A record should be made of who changed it, why, what the original record
was and when the change was made.</p>
<p>Where data has been entered into the wrong patient's record, this data
should be removed in line with the guidance above and should be copied
to the correct patient's record. Care should be taken to protect the
confidentiality of both patients by ensuring no identifiers are retained
or transferred between the two records unless there are clear clinical
reasons to do so.</p>
<h3 id="9762-data-is-misleading-or-has-changed-over-time">9.7.6.2 Data is misleading, or has changed over time<a class="headerlink" href="#9762-data-is-misleading-or-has-changed-over-time" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the course of managing a patient the diagnosis may change as more
information becomes available. This may mean that an originally recorded
diagnosis is now known to be wrong, and in this instance it should be
changed or removed as above.</p>
<p>Expressing an 'opinion' is different from recording a 'diagnosis'.
Opinions represent clinical formulations based on knowledge at the time,
and are thus normally correct in context. They also inform management
plans, and thus subsequent actions. In general where an opinion is
subsequently found to be incorrect it should not be altered or removed
if it was correct at the time of recording. In electronic records one
should distinguish between opinion and diagnosis based not just on the
free text but on the Clinical Code or Term used for the record. An
incorrect Code may be associated with free text that is opinion, for
example:</p>
<p>E23..00 Alcohol dependence syndrome: "I suspect drinking to excess but
denies it."</p>
<p>This is opinion but the effect of the Clinical Term used is to give the
patient this diagnosis. Care should be taken to use appropriate codes
when expressing opinions, for example symptom or examination codes
rather than those for conditions. In the example above, assuming the
patient did not have the condition, it would be appropriate to change
the clinical code but retain the free text</p>
<p>On occasion there may be differing clinical opinions regarding a
diagnosis. Electronic records can handle this by qualification,
attribution and linkage of data. That is: by adding free text explaining
the difference of opinion; by ensuring the attributes of any diagnostic
data make it clear who made the diagnosis and when, by expressing any
appropriate qualifiers regarding certainty that may be available in the
terminology; and by linking diagnosis to any associated clinical data
(as occurs in a problem orientated record) so the diagnosis may be
viewed in context. Where the patient disagrees with the diagnosis (or
opinion) it would be appropriate to record this.</p>
<h3 id="9763-requests-for-data-to-be-removed-or-altered">9.7.6.3 Requests for data to be removed or altered<a class="headerlink" href="#9763-requests-for-data-to-be-removed-or-altered" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This may occur where there is dispute about content of the record by a
patient or third party. If the record is known to be incorrect, then it
should be changed or deleted as above. Otherwise, changing or removing
data from the record is not recommended as it will obfuscate the
subsequent actions of health care workers who have since used the
record.</p>
<p>Completely removing data from an electronic medical record is not
possible for end users -- all approved clinical information systems in
the UK have an 'audit trail' which will record all changes to a record,
saving the original data so that it may be used for medico-legal
purposes if required. Where patients request removal of data from the
record and this is agreed they must be made aware that the changes will
be stored in the audit trail.</p>
<p>More guidance on these topics is available from the National Information
Governance Board[^9]</p>
<h3 id="977-consulting-with-computers">9.7.7 Consulting with Computers<a class="headerlink" href="#977-consulting-with-computers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Many clinicians find the change to working paper-light challenging. As
well as the learning curve required to become familiar with the clinical
information system; they also have to learn how to interact with the
computer in the consulting room, in effect adding a new participant to
their consultation (see also Chapter 12)</p>
<h3 id="9771-keyboard-skills">9.7.7.1 Keyboard Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#9771-keyboard-skills" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>At present all GP clinical systems rely on keyboards and mice for
navigation and input. Although voice control can be implemented for some
systems, it is not immediately useful, requires training of the computer
and the user and cannot replace the requirement for typing skills. Using
voice for data entry or navigation may not be appropriate during a
consultation.</p>
<p>Clinicians do need to learn keyboard skills to use computers. Methods of
learning include internet-based or computer-assisted programmes, as well
as specific face-to-face classes. Users should learn keyboard skills,
not just typing, as being able to use the shortcuts and functions of a
computer keyboard will aid their navigation and use of systems.</p>
<p>Touch-typing is not a necessity, although can be an advantage.</p>
<h3 id="9772-how-to-sit">9.7.7.2 How to sit<a class="headerlink" href="#9772-how-to-sit" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As the computer becomes more important to the clinical interaction, and
the primary source of information about the patient, it is important
that it is accessible to the clinician without requiring them to turn
away from the patient. Placement of the computer monitor, keyboard,
mouse and printer should take this into account.</p>
<p>Placing the patient-doctor-computer in a triangular formation is
considered the most appropriate configuration -- this is called 'triadic
consulting'[^10].</p>
<p>This allows the GP to refer to the screen without turning away from the
patient, and also facilitates shared screens, where the computer display
may be shown to the patient.</p>
<p>Care should also be taken to ensure the screen is not viewable by third
parties attending with the patient, unless it is with the patient's
consent. Similarly, care must be taken to ensure the record shown on the
screen relates only to the patient and no others. For example,
appointment books and reports from aggregated records may include names
of other patients.</p>
<p>The configuration of some consulting rooms, the distribution of network
access points and power points is not always conducive to this type of
arrangement, but attempts should be made using extensions and
replacement of access points to try and move towards this.
Configurations where the computer monitor is behind the doctor should
always be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="9773-multi-tasking">9.7.7.3 Multi-tasking<a class="headerlink" href="#9773-multi-tasking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In general it is not possible to try and talk to or examine a patient at

Clinicians should keep their attention on the patient, or the computer
but not both together.</p>

<p>It is useful to be able to share the information on the screen with the
patient. This may be to confirm the information is correct, to reinforce
a piece of advice or to provide explanations and advice. This is a
learned skill, and not all clinicians are immediately comfortable with
showing parts of the record to the patient. Providing specific 'patient
friendly' displays of clinical data, such as blood pressures, can make
this easier.</p>

<p>A staged, iterative approach to educating clinicians on using their
computers can be effective. No clinician should feel they must be able
to do every task from the first day of using their computer system. Any
learning and adapting skills requires time, and this must be
accommodated into the working day.</p>
<p>For example, SCIMP publish a guide titled '26 weeks to Using Computers
in the Consultation'<a href="http://www.scimp.scot.nhs.uk/documents/appendix%205.doc">^11</a>. This can be adapted to suit specific systems
and clinician's needs.</p>
<h3 id="978-results">9.7.8 Results<a class="headerlink" href="#978-results" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The management of the receipt of results in the paper-light practice has
three main solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Transcription with paper review</strong> - Where clerical staff manually
    enter a subset of results to the computer record. This may only be
    for abnormal or significant results as identified by the clinical
    staff, or results required for contractual purposes. The paper
    result is filed to the paper notes and remains the definitive record
    used for processing purposes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Scanning with transcription</strong> - Where clerical staff manually
    enter a subset of results as above, but the paper result is scanned
    to the DMS and associated with the patient record. The scanned
    document is then the definitive record, and is used for processing
    via the DMS and clinical system.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Electronic Data Transfer or 'Pathology Links'</strong> - Where the
    results data is received electronically by the practice's clinical
    information system and filed directly to the patient record using
    appropriate clinical terms and data areas. The clinical system will
    have results handling functions to manage clinical workflow.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter process is generally the preferred scenario. Transcription of
results increases the risk of data entry errors. Provided the result
used for processing is the original record, transcribing the results
from paper can be a useful interim measure on the pathway to
paper-light.</p>
<p>Pathology Links can be enabled with agreement of your system supplier,
PCO and local laboratory service. Training should be provided for
administrative and clinical staff and the practice needs to consider how
to fit the new processes safely into the practice workflow.</p>
<p>Results from other tests such as spirometry and ECGs can sometimes be
integrated into the clinical system directly via software that links the
device making the measurement with the clinical information system.
There is no standard solution, and each clinical system tends to provide
integration with various third party suppliers.</p>
<p>Whatever the approach adopted, practices must have a robust system in
place for taking appropriate action on incoming results and reports.</p>
<h3 id="9781-test-ordering">9.7.8.1 Test Ordering<a class="headerlink" href="#9781-test-ordering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In some parts of the UK it is now also possible to request tests from
laboratories using an electronic service integrated with GP systems.</p>
<h3 id="979-document-management">9.7.9 Document Management<a class="headerlink" href="#979-document-management" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>An essential part of paper-light working requires the practice to
utilise a Document Management System (DMS) to handle correspondence.
This is often referred to as 'Document Scanning' and will consist of a
document scanner and associated software, which stores the scanned
images and allows them to be viewed on the computer monitor.</p>
<p>Once backed up, the original documents may then be shredded, within some
safety and legal constraints, saving space and removing the need to file
the paper into a patient record. There are two main types of document
scanning -- concurrent scanning, where documents are scanned to the
record as they arrive thus, over time, reducing the need to refer to
archived paper correspondence in the paper notes; and archive scanning,
or 'back scanning', where the paper notes are scanned to the DMS to make
the full historical paper record available from the computer.</p>
<h3 id="9791-preparing-for-scanning">9.7.9.1 Preparing for Scanning<a class="headerlink" href="#9791-preparing-for-scanning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Commonly scanning of incoming and outgoing correspondence is a stage
undertaken after practices have moved to note-less recording. Practices
must have in place methods for summarising notes and up to date
summaries recorded on the clinical system. The practice should consult
with their PCO and the system supplier to assess which DMS is available
for them to employ.</p>
<p>The PCO and the DMS supplier will be able to assist with a site survey,
and recommend a particular hardware and software implementation. Even
small practices should consider having more than one scanning device to
cope with technical faults in their main scanner. Larger practices may
require several scanning locations and devices through their sites.</p>
<p>DMS providers should also provide training in use of the software, and
appropriate filing procedures.</p>
<p>Practices should ensure that all staff and clinicians who need access to
documents and correspondence in the practice are provided with logon
credentials for the system; are able to view, navigate and workflow
documents; and are aware of the practice's new policies.</p>
<h3 id="9792-document-workflow">9.7.9.2 Document Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#9792-document-workflow" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>'Workflow' in this context refers to the processing of incoming and
outgoing correspondence. The movement of paper around practices is
complex and widely varied -- practices all work to systems suited to
their own requirements. Moving to scanning documents will constrain some
of this workflow within the functionality available from the DMS.</p>
<p>Practices should at least ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Documents are uniquely filed against the patient to whom they
    apply</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>All people who need to view and read a document can and will do so</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Documents can be marked as read</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Actions required from documents are achieved and confirmed. For
    example:</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Appointments made</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Results communicated to patients</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Prescriptions provided or changed</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clinical codes and data is captured</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Exceptions are managed safely. For example:</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Staff absence -- planned and unplanned</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Who will manage an absent users documents?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How will a user returning from absence manage a backlog of
    &gt; documents?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How will documents that cannot be scanned be handled?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>A process for managing misfiled items.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Practices moving from a paper based mail management system to an
electronic one must consider how they will workflow the documents. A DMS
will provide workflow and routing functions. Practices should
investigate these prior to accepting the deployment to ensure the
functions provided will allow for a safe and workable system in their
organisation.</p>
<p>The practice may have a social function associated with reading the
mail, and this will perhaps change. Consideration should be given as to
how informal communication between clinical staff can be maintained.</p>
<h3 id="9793-scanning-processes">9.7.9.3 Scanning Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#9793-scanning-processes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Normally the practice will train and engage clerical staff for this
process. Clerical staff must be aware of the importance of filing
documents accurately and chronologically, and complying with any folder
structure. Staff must review scanned documents at the time to ensure
they are legible and complete. Where a document has failed to scan
practices must have a policy for handling this.</p>
<p>Practices normally scan documents in Black and White or Greyscale. Where
a document is in colour and the colour is important to its meaning staff
should know how to change the default scanning process to create a
colour scan.</p>
<p>Optical Character Recognition is a process whereby a scanned document
image is analysed to extract the text. This text can then be used for
other purposes, such as indexing and searching. This can be a useful
function to employ, but has implications for storage and speed of
processing.</p>
<h3 id="9794-data-recording">9.7.9.4 Data recording<a class="headerlink" href="#9794-data-recording" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A method of capturing data from correspondence is required as simply
scanning the document is not adequate from a data quality perspective;
clinical codes and data should still be recorded from documents.</p>
<p>In general, a scanned document associated with a patient will be
recorded in the DMS but should also be linked to the clinical system's
patient record either directly by the systems or indirectly via a text
description of the location of the file. An appropriate clinical term
should be entered into the system to indicate that correspondence has
been attached to the record.</p>
<h3 id="9795-other-practice-documents-and-attachments">9.7.9.5 Other practice documents and attachments<a class="headerlink" href="#9795-other-practice-documents-and-attachments" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Practices may consider scanning other received mail to the DMS, for
example guidelines and protocols, local service information and so
forth.</p>
<p>Files other than scanned documents may be attached to the DMS. For
example, clinical photographs, PDF files, word processed documents and
web pages. (See Chapter 10 of these guidelines for more information).</p>
<h3 id="9796-scanning-historical-records-back-scanning">9.7.9.6 Scanning Historical Records -- "back-scanning"<a class="headerlink" href="#9796-scanning-historical-records-back-scanning" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>This process has been undertaken by some practices that wish to have the
entire historical primary care record stored on their DMS. This may be
of value where the practice wishes to be able to archive the paper
records, perhaps returning them to the Health Authority, thus freeing up
space in the practice; it can help with paper-light working by removing
the requirement to refer to the paper records for old correspondence. It
may improve clinical safety, by making the records more accessible, and
in some instances may be cheaper than establishing a paper records
filing store.</p>
<p>Practices should examine the business advantages to this process against
the financial cost. Various companies offer this process as a service,
and practices should examine what is offered and consider if the methods
used will increase the utility of the record. In general it is good
practice to scan archived documents into the DMS using some type of
filing structure, to distinguish between the various sections of the
medical record. Scanning the entire record to a single, multipage image
file may risk losing some of the inherent structure and utility of the
paper notes and should be avoided (See also 9.7.5.1 above).</p>
<p>Comprehensive advice on scanning historical records is available from
the SCIMP website<a href="http://www.scimp.scot.nhs.uk/documents/BackScanningSCIMP2009_Final.doc">^12</a>.</p>
<h3 id="9797-shredding">9.7.9.7 Shredding<a class="headerlink" href="#9797-shredding" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Paper-light practices employing scanning should establish safe processes
for the subsequent destruction of the original documents (see also
chapter 10). In general this applies to documents attached to the record
rather than the original record itself (e.g. Lloyd George envelope
contents).</p>
<p>Documents can be shredded after they have been scanned, confirmed as
legible, backed up, and that backup has been verified (confirmed local
tape read-back). Practices should ideally employ a crosscut shredder,
although there is no NHS required standard. In some areas PCOs provide a
secure document destruction service, and commercial operators also
exist.</p>

<p>Moving referral systems to an electronic interface has become
increasingly common in recent years with the advent of on line referral
services from the NHS such as 'Choose and Book' in England and 'SCI
Gateway' in Scotland, which is expected to be adapted for use in Wales
and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>These systems have been integrated with GP systems such that the
referral process and correspondence this generates is captured into the
patient record. Much of the content of the referral will be
automatically generated by merging data from the patient's clinical
record:</p>
<p>From Choose &amp; Book guidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The electronic referral letter will automatically be populated with
Problems, Consultation, Medication, Allergies, Family History,
Investigations, Values and Social information from the patient's
record."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accuracy and relevance of the merged information will rely on the
quality of the practice's summaries and merged referral data should
always be checked by the author to ensure that the data is correct and
appropriate. This may include the need to remove inappropriate sensitive
patient information or other information the patient wishes to be
withheld.</p>
<p>Other facilities may also be available such as the ability to attach
external documents (see Chapter 9); or to request information and
guidance alone, short of a formal referral.</p>
<p>The referral is then sent electronically to the hospital and the
appointment may be arranged directly by the GP Practice, or organised by
the medical records department.</p>
<p>The increasing complexity of these systems makes it advisable for the GP
practice to have at least one member of staff and clinician who is
properly trained in their operation. It is particularly important that
any workflow features of the system are safely integrated into the wider
context of practice communications handling. For example: checking for
unsent referrals, ensuring interim messages back from providers are
actioned, and that the system is not disrupted during spells of absence
by clinical or administrative staff.</p>

<p>If a practice does not have access to an online referral service, the
practice should still consider using their clinical system to generate
referral letters -- clinical systems normally have the functions to
generate mail merged letters and to save these linked to the patient
record. In some situations it may be required to create paper letters
and then scan these back into the DMS, although such workflows are
usually transitional workarounds for practices en route to paper-light.</p>

<p>Receipt of discharge details from hospitals electronically returned to
practices is now available in a few locations. This can take the form of
a document that contains 'metadata' about the discharge, allowing
identification of the patient, the event and clinical data. It may allow
direct import of the document into the DMS with appropriate attribution
as well as provide mechanisms to file clinical data to the patient
record.</p>

<p>When patients transfer out of the practice the practice needs to prepare
the record for forwarding to the patient's next practice. In paper-light
practices there are various methods for achieving this. The principle
requirement is that the full medical record is transferred, thus the
practice must ensure that the clinical record from the clinical
information system and the document record from the document management
system is sent (See Chapters 8b &amp; 10).</p>
<p><strong>Print</strong> - Clinical information systems contain functions to allow
reporting on the full medical record in a structured and readable way
for sending on. The practice should familiarise itself with these
functions, and ensure staff responsible for registration management in
the practice are able to use them. All clinical documents should also be
printed from the document management system.</p>
<p><strong>GP2GP</strong> - In some areas of the UK 'GP2GP' allows for electronic
transmission of the patient's record in the clinical information system
to the receiving practice. This also allows for attachments to the

<p>Practices have requirements to be able to work with patients or their
records and practice data outside of the practice premises. This
requirement arises through clinical staff visiting patients at home,
carrying out 'ward rounds' in care homes, and taking administrative work
home. With internet technologies and telephony the prospect of being
able to conduct telephone or tele-health surgeries from locations other
than the practice is becoming more realistic.</p>

<p>The use of portable computing devices (Pocket PCs, Laptops) in
conjunction with specific software applications can allow a clinician to
carry a version of the practice's electronic records with them outside
the practice. Typically these devices carry only a subset of the data
from the practice system, and will not provide full the functionality
available in the main system. On return to the practice the device is
then synchronised with the practice's clinical system.</p>
<p>In some instances it is possible to copy the practice data to a
standalone computer, which can run the clinical application. As with all
removable data, this requires strong encryption. In this scenario, the
data is for 'read only' purposes, and any changes will not be written
back to the practice's main data.</p>
<h3 id="97122-synchronous-remote-access">9.7.12.2 Synchronous Remote Access<a class="headerlink" href="#97122-synchronous-remote-access" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In this scenario the clinician accesses the practice data live, remotely
from another workstation external to the practice's local area network.
Commercial companies do provide this service for the general public
(e.g. 'logmein.com'), but the use of such services for the NHS is
subject to approval from your PCO. Risks of using a non-accredited
commercial company include potentially inadequate encryption and the
location of servers, which may be outside of the UK. Such services
normally require a computer in the practice remains switched on and is
used for the remote worker.</p>
<p>The approved methods of obtaining access remotely to the practice system
varies in different PCO areas, some providing an electronic 'token' to
access the practice network through the national NHS network (N3) with a
home computer, others require a specifically configured and purchased PC
to be used. As the security risks are real and the configuration of
remote access systems is complex, practices should not consider using a
bespoke implementation for this task.</p>
<p>Accessing the practice data live and remotely from the patient's bedside
remains experimental at present in all but a few cases, but the
technology (such as high bandwidth connections using cellular telephony
3G) does exist to enable this. The use of wirelessly networked smart
pens, combined with data entry forms, has been employed in some areas
for specific care functions.</p>

<p>Using reports from the clinical information system, clinicians should be
able to carry a summary of patient data on paper for the purpose of home
working or home visits. This is not always satisfactory as the data may
be incomplete but is often a pragmatic solution when no electronic
option is available. Care must be taken, of course, when carrying
records outside of the practice.</p>

<h3 id="991-introduction">9.9.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#991-introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In October 2000, the then NHS Executive changed GPs' terms of service to
allow them to maintain part or all of their patient medical records on a
computer system if they so wished. The change in regulations covers GPs
working under both GMS and PMS contracts. Advice and guidance was issued
to health authorities (working with their local medical committees) to
develop mechanisms to allow the efficient discharge of their
responsibility to approve requests to introduce electronic record
keeping. With effect from 1st Oct 2002 and in accordance with Schedule 5
of the NHS Reform and Healthcare Professions Act 2002 (supplementary,
consequential etc. provision) this function has been transferred to
Primary Care Organisations.</p>
<h3 id="992-national-guidance">9.9.2 National guidance<a class="headerlink" href="#992-national-guidance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The changes to GPs' terms of service are permissive, allowing practices
to keep computerised patient records instead of paper records. PCO
approval is required when practices plan to keep computerised patient
records in whole or in part. The legislation also applies to practices
that were paperless before 1st October 2000.</p>
<p>Practices need to apply for paperless status when they propose to keep
some or all of their records in electronic format only. Approval is
permissive -- practices maintaining EPRs can still maintain paper
records if they so wish - but a practice may only maintain wholly
electronic records if approved. Keeping duplicate paper and electronic
records introduces the potential risk of the two record systems losing
synchrony, information held on one not always being transferred to the
other.</p>
<p>There are no mechanisms for penalising practices that are "paperless"
but not approved although this would not be a wise position for a
practice to find itself in. GPs who maintain EPRs must be able to
generate a paper printout of the entire patient's records (including any
scanned or linked documents) to be forwarded to their PCO on request.</p>
<p>Although the PCO cannot make any determination as to the content or
adequacy of the record, it has an obvious duty to satisfy itself that
any EPRs are being properly maintained and held securely.</p>
<p>GPs and PCOs should try to ensure that clinical systems are fit for
purpose within the overall NHS strategic direction outlined in Chapter 1
of these Guidelines. (e.g. those systems that are approved under the GP
System of Choice (GPSoC) framework<a href="GPSoC">^16</a>).</p>

<p>Existing guidance to PCOs makes clear that "individual practices will
decide how to implement electronic record keeping locally". PCOs have a
key role in satisfying themselves that practices are ready to safely
maintain EPRs, but there is no requirement for them to use any
pre-determined process before giving consent. Indeed, PCOs are strongly
advised to agree suitable processes locally with their LMCs. PCOs do not
have any requirement to monitor ongoing standards of record keeping in
practices but they can withdraw consent in exceptional circumstances.
Once again, a procedure for dealing with this situation should be agreed
between the PCO and the LMC. The PCO's main role is to approve
appropriate applications and to ensure that practices receive the
support they require to safely make the transition from paper to
electronic records. Experience to date strongly supports the development
of a joint approach to practice approval by PCOs and LMCs.</p>
