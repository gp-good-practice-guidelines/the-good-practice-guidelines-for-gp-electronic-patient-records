# Appendix - GPGv4 Contributors

The Good Practice Guidelines depend on the contribution of many
individuals and organisations and is a genuinely collaborative effort
between professional representative bodies, generously supported by NHS
CFH and the Department of Health. The Joint GP IT Committee would like
to thank all those involved in producing these guidelines. We
acknowledge below most of the principal contributors but would also like
to thank those many others who also supported and advised the authors.
