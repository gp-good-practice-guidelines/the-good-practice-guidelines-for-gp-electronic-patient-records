Chapter 2 - The Purposes of Health Records


These will be reviewed under the headings of: clinical, non-clinical,
additional and emerging purposes.

### 2.1 Clinical purposes

Traditionally primary and community care health professionals require
patient record systems that have the following functionality:

-   *Facilitate the clinical care of individual patients by:*

    -   *Assisting the health professional to structure his or her
        thoughts and make appropriate decisions*

    -   *Acting as an aide memoir for the health professional during
        subsequent consultations*

    -   *Making information available to others with access to the
        record system who are involved in the care of the same patient*

    -   *Providing information for inclusion in other documents (e.g.
        laboratory requests, referrals and medical reports)*

    -   *Storing information received from other parties or
        organisations (e.g. laboratory results and letters from
        specialists)*

    -   *Transfer the record to any NHS practice with which the patient
        subsequently registers (GP record) *

    -   *Providing information to patients about their health and health
        care*

<!-- -->

-   *Assist in the clinical care of the practice population by:*

    -   *Assessing the health needs of the population*

    -   *Identifying target groups and enabling call and recall
        programmes*

    -   *Monitoring the progress of health promotion initiatives*

    -   *Providing patients with an opportunity to contribute to their
        records*

    -   *Supporting medical audit*

### 2.2 Non-clinical purposes

Health organisations also need a patient record system that can be used
to meet administrative and contractual obligations by:

-   *Providing medicoâ€‘legal evidence (e.g. to defend against claims of
    negligence)*

-   *Providing legal evidence in respect of claims by a patient against
    a third party (e.g. for injuries, occupational diseases and in
    respect of product liability)*

-   *Providing reports and information for third parties (e.g. insurance
    companies)*

-   *To support claims for benefits and other additional social support*

-   *Recording when and to whom such evidence is provided*

-   *Meeting the requirements of specific legislation on subject access
    to personal data and health records*

-   *Recording the preferences of patients in respect of access to and
    disclosure of information they have provided in confidence*

-   *Providing evidence of workload within a health organisation*

-   *Providing evidence of workload to support claims and bids for
    resources*

-   *To enable commissioning of community and secondary healthcare
    services*

-   *Monitoring the use of external resource usage (e.g. prescribing,
    laboratory requests and referrals)*

### 2.3 Additional purposes

Health organisations are increasingly likely to require a patient record
system that can be used:

-   *To interact with a decision support/expert-system (likely to become
    a core clinical requirement)*

-   *To support teaching and continuing medical education*

-   *To support clinical governance activities*

-   *To implement security and access control regimes for patient
    confidential information*

-   *To support professional appraisal and revalidation*

-   *To enable:*

    -   *Epidemiological monitoring*

    -   *Surveillance of possible adverse effects of drugs*

    -   *Clinical research*

### 2.4 Emerging purposes

Health records created in one health environment are increasingly likely
to be accessed for viewing and/or editing in other health environments
for example:

-   *A read-only shared record following an act of publication (e.g. the
    SCR in England and the ECS in Scotland)*

-   *A read-only system giving access to an external electronic health
    record system (e.g. Graphnet)*

-   *Read and write access to a single logical record - or separate
    records (e.g. TPP SystmOne & EmisWeb respectively)*

-   *A shared record dependent on messaging (e.g. pathology request and
    report)*

-   *Interfacing with medical devices : telehealth/telecare*

-   *New requirements for patients to have increasing control of their
    health records*[^1]

The main health benefits of shared records are likely to be improvements
in the quality and safety of care, in access to care or in cost
effectiveness.

This has important implications for clinical record keeping in terms of
data quality, semantics, clinical coding, staff education and training.
Making health records "fit for sharing" will require health
professionals to think in new ways about clinical record keeping and
what it means to use and create genuinely "inter-operable" electronic
patient records that can be safely shared with other health
professionals *and* patients.
